I like to buy clothes because i remember when I was young, I didn't have clothes to go places so I had to get that together I cook because when im older I wont need nobody to cook for me or I wont have to do fast food everyday.  And i like playing the game to keep me out of trouble.i like to watch the nba because its intresting.
